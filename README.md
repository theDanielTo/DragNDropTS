# Project-ManagerTS

### A super light-weight app to manage "projects" where the user can create "project" cards that can be dragged to 'Active' or 'Finished' sections.
###### Meant for educational purposes (for me lol).
###### Written in TypeScript to support ES6

## Tech used
* OOP with strict typing
* Interfaces used as class & type templates
* Decorator to bind '@Autobind' function
* ES6 modules (import/export)
* Drag & Drop API
* Vanilla JS state management
